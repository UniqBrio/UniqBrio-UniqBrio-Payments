## Component Responsibilities

### Core Components
- **payment-types.ts**: Contains all TypeScript interfaces including `PaymentRecord`, `PaymentSummary`, and currency symbols
- **payment-data.ts**: Mock payment records and course-wise payment data
- **use-payment-logic.ts**: Custom hook containing all business logic for filtering, sorting, and state management

### UI Components
- **payment-table.tsx**: Main table container with headers
- **payment-table-row.tsx**: Individual row rendering with status badges, currency formatting, and action buttons
- **payment-filters.tsx**: Search bar, status filters, category filters, and export functionality
- **payment-summary-cards.tsx**: Financial summary cards showing totals, received, outstanding, and profit

### Feature Components
- **student-manual-payment.tsx**: Comprehensive manual payment system accessible from header
- **course-wise-payment-popup.tsx**: Course-wise payment summary with collection rates and progress bars
- **column-visibility.tsx**: Allows users to show/hide table columns

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Manual Payment from Actions Column
- **Before**: Each row had a manual payment button (Banknote icon)
- **After**: Actions column only contains reminder functionality (Send icon)
- **Rationale**: Centralized manual payment system through header button

### 2. Centralized Manual Payment System
- **Location**: Header "Manual Payment" button
- **Functionality**: Search by Student ID, comprehensive payment recording
- **Features**: Amount entry, date selection, payment mode, notes

### 3. Actions Column Focus
- **Purpose**: Payment reminders only
- **Visibility**: Only shows for students with outstanding balances and enabled reminders
- **Functionality**: Send payment reminders via SMS, Email, or WhatsApp

### 4. Code Organization Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components can be used in other parts of the application
- **Performance**: Smaller components enable better code splitting
- **Testing**: Isolated components are easier to test

## Usage

The main page (`app/payments/page.tsx`) is now only 112 lines and imports these modular components:

```typescript
import { PaymentFilters } from './components/payment-filters'
import { PaymentSummaryCards } from './components/payment-summary-cards'
import { PaymentTable } from './components/payment-table'
import { usePaymentLogic } from './components/use-payment-logic'
// ... other imports
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should handle one specific feature
2. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript interfaces from `payment-types.ts`
3. **State Management**: Use the `usePaymentLogic` hook for shared state
4. **Styling**: Follow the existing Tailwind CSS patterns with purple theme
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Future Enhancements

- Add unit tests for each component
- Implement real API integration
- Add payment history tracking
- Enhance filtering capabilities
- Add bulk operations support
